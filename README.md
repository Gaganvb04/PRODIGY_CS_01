# PRODIGY_CS_01
Task-01 Caesar Cipher by using python
# Caesar Cipher (All Printable Characters)

This Python program implements a Caesar Cipher that works with **all printable ASCII characters**, not just letters. It allows the user to **encrypt or decrypt** messages using a shift key, and it loops until the user chooses to exit.

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt any text using a Caesar Cipher
- Supports all printable characters (letters, digits, symbols, whitespace)
- Repeats until the user decides to quit
- Simple and interactive command-line interface
- Graceful error handling for invalid inputs

## How It Works

The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each character in the message by a specified number of positions in the `string.printable` character set. Decryption reverses this process.

Example:
=== Caesar Cipher===

Type 'encrypt' for encryption, type 'decrypt' for decryption:
encrypt
Type your message:
Gagan V B@123
Enter shift key:
8

Encrypted Message: Oioiv2$2J|9ab

Type 'yes' to continue, type 'no' to exit:
yes

Type 'encrypt' for encryption, type 'decrypt' for decryption:
decrypt
Type your message:
Oioiv2$2J|9ab
Enter shift key:
8

Decrypted Message: Gagan V B@123

Type 'yes' to continue, type 'no' to exit:
no
Have a nice day! Bye...
